analysis.**

Project Objectives:
1. Data Exploration:
- Explore the Sentiment Analysis dataset to understand its structure, features,
and size.
- Identify key variables such as text content and sentiment labels.
2. Data Preprocessing:
- Perform text preprocessing tasks, including lowercasing, removing stop
words, and handling special characters.
- Tokenize and lemmatize words to prepare the text for sentiment analysis.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Conduct exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the distribution of
sentiment labels.
- Visualize the distribution using histograms or pie charts to understand the
balance of sentiment classes.

INTERN PROJECT PHASE - 2

Project Objectives:
. Text Vectorization:
- Convert the preprocessed text into numerical vectors using techniques like
TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word embeddings.
- Choose an appropriate vectorization method based on the characteristics of the
dataset.
. Model Selection:
- Explore and implement different machine learning models suitable for text
classification, such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, or deep learning
models like LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks.
- Evaluate the performance of each model using metrics like accuracy, precision,
recall, and F1 score.
. Hyperparameter Tuning:
- Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the selected model to optimize its
performance.
- Utilize techniques like grid search or random search for hyperparameter
optimization.
. Cross-Validation:
- Implement cross-validation techniques to assess the generalization
performance of the model and prevent overfitting.
. Model Interpretability:
- Interpret the model's predictions by analyzing feature importance or using
techniques like LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations).
- Understand which words or features contribute most to sentiment predictions.
. Evaluation Metrics:
- Evaluate the model's performance using relevant evaluation metrics for
sentiment analysis, such as confusion matrix, precision-recall curves, and
ROC-AUC.
