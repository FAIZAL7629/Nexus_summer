##Project 1 Requirements:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- **Perform EDA on the stock market dataset to understand its structure and
characteristics.**
- **Visualize key statistics and trends in stock prices.**
  
2. Predictive Modeling:
- **Utilize machine learning techniques to predict stock prices.**
- **Implement regression models to forecast future stock values.**
3. Documentation:
  
- **Document your approach, methodologies, and insights gained from the stock
market dataset.**
- **Provide clear explanations for the chosen predictive models.**

##Project 2 Requirements:

**1. Data Preprocessing:
- Clean and preprocess the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset.
- Handle missing values, outliers, and any other inconsistencies in the data
  
2. Feature Selection and Engineering:
- Identify relevant features for breast cancer prediction.
- Create new features or transformations that might enhance the predictive
model's performance.

3. Machine Learning Model (SVM):
- Implement a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for classifying tumors into
malignant or benign.
- Train and evaluate the model on the Breast Cancer dataset.
  
4. Documentation:
- Document your data preprocessing, feature selection, and machine learning
model implementation.
- Explain the model's performance metrics and any challenges faced during the
analysis.**
